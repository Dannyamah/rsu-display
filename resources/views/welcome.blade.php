                    In order to improve on the efficiency of this remote
                    web-based digital display system, further research was conducted
                    to eliminate all limitations. This entails developing this 
                    website capable of uploading information
                    from any part of the globe in real time. This website also provides an
                    option for manual upload at the expense of cost effectiveness and
                    vulnerability.This design and implementation of the web-based 
                    LED digital display system provides an efficient way through
                    which Nigerian universities/institutions,
                    government and businesses can communicate
                    information to the public locally and globally. Conclusively the hardware
                    also fetches the information to be displayed from the
                    database which is uploaded by the admin.
